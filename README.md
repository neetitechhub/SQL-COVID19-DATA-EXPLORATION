# Covid-19 Data Exploration

This project involved exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL to extract meaningful insights on global infection, death rates, and vaccinations.

**Skills Applied:**

1. Joins
2. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
3. Temporary Tables
4. Window Functions
5. Aggregate Functions
6. Creating Views
7. Data Type Conversion

**Steps:**

**Database Creation:**

1. Created a new database: Covid19Details.
2. Imported the dataset in CSV format using SQL Serverâ€™s Import Flat File wizard.
3. Selected appropriate data types during the import process.

**Database Setup:** > The database was successfully created and loaded with COVID-19 data.

**Key Analytical Queries:**

1. Initial Data Overview: Retrieved the dataset to understand the structure and data available for analysis.
2. Total Cases vs. Total Deaths: Analyzed the correlation between total cases and deaths across countries.
3. Mortality Rate by Country: Showed the likelihood of dying if infected by COVID-19 for each country.
4. Total Cases vs. Population: Compared the number of COVID-19 cases to the population size.
5. Infection Rate: Calculated the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19.
6. Highest Infection Rates Identified countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
7. Highest Death Rates: Found countries with the highest death counts relative to their population.
8. Continents with Highest Death Rates:** Analyzed continents with the highest death counts per population.
9. Global Numbers: Summarized global statistics for COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
10. Population vs. Vaccinations: Compared total population to vaccination rates.
11. Vaccination Percentage: Calculated the percentage of the population that received at least one vaccine dose.

**Advanced Techniques:**
12. CTE Calculation: Used CTEs to partition data for further analysis.
13. Temp Table Calculation: Created temporary tables to partition data and perform calculations on subsets of data.
14. Creating Views: Created views to store aggregated results for use in later visualizations.
